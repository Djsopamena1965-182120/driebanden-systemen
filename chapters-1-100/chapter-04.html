 <h1>Chapter 4 — Cut Shot System with 2 and 3 Effect (Part 02)</h1>

  <!-- ✅ 4.1 INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>4.1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In this chapter we discuss the cut shot system where the cue ball is played with 
      <strong>2 or 3 effect</strong>. This system is applied when the natural line 
      of the cue ball is not sufficient to create the correct angle, and extra spin is needed to make the ball 
      “pull” or “run”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using 2 and 3 effect requires more control and precision, because the deviation after contact with 
      the rail becomes greater. This chapter helps you understand when to use which effect and how to 
      predict the running line.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 4.2 BASIC PRINCIPLE -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>4.2 Basic Principle of 2 and 3 Effect</h2>
    <p>
      When playing with 2 or 3 effect, the angle of the cue ball changes significantly. 
      The ball gains extra rotation which causes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the ball to run longer after the rail</li>
      <li>the ball to “pull” more towards the long rail</li>
      <li>greater deviation when contacting the object ball</li>
      <li>speed to play a bigger role</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The basic rule is:
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; color:#4da3ff;">
      ➤ More effect = greater angle change = longer running line
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that with 2 or 3 effect you must always take into account a longer route to the third rail.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 4.3 REFERENCE POINTS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>4.3 Reference Points and Corrections</h2>
    <p>
      The reference points for this system are similar to those of chapters 2 and 3, 
      but are adjusted based on the amount of effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player should pay attention to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>the thickness of the object ball</li>
      <li>the distance to the first rail</li>
      <li>the speed of the cue ball</li>
      <li>the position of the second ball</li>
      <li>the amount of effect (2 or 3)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With 3 effect the deviation is the greatest, requiring more correction in direction and speed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 4.4 EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLES -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>4.4 Explanation and Examples</h2>

    <p>
      The figures below show typical situations where 2 or 3 effect is necessary to create the correct 
      running line. The figures show the ideal route of the cue ball and the influence of effect on 
      the angle change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pay special attention to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>how much effect you use</li>
      <li>the thickness of the object ball</li>
      <li>the distance to the first rail</li>
      <li>the speed of the cue ball</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Small variations in effect can cause large differences in the final arrival line. 
      This system is ideal for training feel and control.
