  <!-- ✅ 1.1 INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The Basic Diamond System is one of the most used and most reliable systems in the three‑cushion game.
      In about 30% of all occurring shot patterns this system can be directly applied. It is therefore an
      indispensable foundation for any player who wants to learn systematic calculation in three‑cushion.
    </p>

    <p>This chapter clearly explains:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How the system works</li>
      <li>What the basic formula is</li>
      <li>When the system does work</li>
      <li>When the system does not work</li>
      <li>How to correctly use the reference points</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 1.2 BASIC FORMULA -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>1.2 The Basic Formula</h2>
    <p>The core of the system is surprisingly simple:</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; color:#4da3ff;">
      ➤ Aim point = Departure point – Arrival point
    </p>

    <p>This formula is used for all shots where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You play via the long rail</li>
      <li>The route then goes to the short rail</li>
      <li>The departure point is numerically higher than the arrival point</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The system only works if these conditions hold.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 1.3 DIAMONDS AND REFERENCE POINTS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>1.3 Diamonds and Reference Points</h2>
    <p>
      To work with the Basic Diamond System, the player must become familiar with three values:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Departure (D)</strong> — value of the cue ball position</li>
      <li><strong>Aim (A)</strong> — the diamond you must aim at</li>
      <li><strong>Arrival (R)</strong> — place where the ball must arrive on the third rail</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 1.4 EXTENDED EXPLANATION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>1.4 Extended Explanation of the Basic Diamond System</h2>

    <p>
      This system is considered the universal system for the three‑cushion game.
      It is not unusual that during a match more than 30% of the shot patterns qualify for this technique.
      The examples below are just a small selection of patterns that are suitable for this method.
    </p>

    <h3>The Basic Formula</h3>
    <p>This formula you must learn — it forms the core of the system:</p>

    <p style="font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; color:#4da3ff;">
      Aim point = Departure point – Arrival point
    </p>

    <p>
      Memorizing the counts for the different reference points — departure (D), aim (A) and arrival (R) —
      takes a bit more time. The values of those points are different for each rail and not regularly distributed.
    </p>

    <h3>Limitation of Validity</h3>
    <p>
      This method is valid for all shots via the long rail to the short rail, where the value of the departure point is
      greater than the value of the arrival point. In the scheme below it is clear that the system is not valid here.
    </p>

    <p>
      The departure point lies at 30 and the arrival point at 50. The maximum reachable point is 30 if you aim at point 0.
    </p>

    </section>

    <h3>The First Step: Determining the Arrival Point</h3>
    <p>
      It is necessary to know the running lines, as indicated in the figure below, by heart.
      The value points are indicated opposite the band markings.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> from the arrival point with value 40 on the long rail (3rd rail), the distance between two markings
      up to value 90 is equal to 20 points.
    </p>

    </section>
    

    <p>
      <strong>Remark:</strong> If the departure point on the short rail has value 50 or more, you must aim at the marking —
      so not at the point opposite the marking.
      If you play from the long rail with a value less than 50, aim at the point opposite the marking.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the two shot patterns in the image above, in both cases you aim at 20.
