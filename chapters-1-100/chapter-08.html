  <h1>Chapter 8:  2‑Effect System</h1>

  <!-- ✅ 8.1 INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>8.1 Figure 01: explained</h2>
    <p>
      The 2‑Effect system focuses entirely on shots where the cue ball is played with
      <strong>standard 2 effect</strong>. In three‑cushion play this is one of the most commonly used
      spin strengths, because it provides an ideal balance between control and deviation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter we look at how 2 effect influences the running line, how to choose the correct aiming points,
      and what corrections are needed under different table conditions and playing positions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 8.2 BASIC PRINCIPLE -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>8.2 Basic Principle of the 2‑Effect System</h2>
    <p>
      With 2 effect the cue ball gains a clearly noticeable sideways rotation, without losing control.
      The spin ensures that the ball:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>makes a larger angle after contact with the rail</li>
      <li>runs longer in the direction of the spin</li>
      <li>becomes sensitive to speed and table speed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In many three‑cushion patterns, 2 effect is the “default setting” from which the player
      makes small adjustments (slightly less or slightly more spin).
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 8.3 REFERENCE POINTS AND CALCULATIONS -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>8.3 Reference Points and Calculations</h2>
    <p>
      The 2‑Effect system uses fixed aiming points on the rails, combined with a
      constant spin strength. The player first chooses:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The starting point of the cue ball</li>
      <li>the desired arrival point on the third rail</li>
      <li>finds the running lines</li>
      <li>applies the two-spin scoring system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Based on this, an aiming point is chosen that is adjusted for 2 effect.
      Small variations in speed or thickness are then used as fine corrections.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ✅ 8.4 EXPLANATION AND EXAMPLES -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>8.4 Explanation and Examples</h2>

    <p>
      The figures below show typical situations where 2 effect is the ideal choice.
      The running lines show how the cue ball behaves with constant spin strength and varying
      departure and arrival points.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pay special attention to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>how the line changes with more or less speed</li>
      <li>the influence of a thicker or thinner object ball</li>
      <li>the shift of the aiming point with different arrival points</li>
      <li>the influence of table speed on the length of the line</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By training these patterns systematically, the player develops a reliable feel
      for 2 effect in different playing positions.
    </p>

<!-- ✅ 8.5 EXPLANATION OF FIGURE 01 -->
<section class="card">
<h2>8.5 Explanation of Figure 01</h2>

</p>
Figure 01 is played individually with 2 effects.
The arrival point is 80, the departure point is 20, and the target point is 60.
Formula: ARRIVAL POINT - DEPARTURE POINT = TARGETING POINT.
You can see that this scoring system is quite simple to learn.
The other figures work the same, even if you play the starting ball via ball 2.
